# USAGE â€” How to Work in This Repo

1) **Create an Issue** with AC, constraints, and examples.
2) Ask Copilot to summarize and propose a plan.
3) Implement a minimal formula in `src/` as plain text.
4) Add examples to `examples/` and test notes to `tests/`.
5) Open a small PR that links the Issue and explicitly checks each AC.

**Tip:** Keep long reasoning and decisions in the Issue to preserve traceability.
